## Two Factor Authentication ##

We do not currently support GitHub's Two-Factor Authentication system. However, you can generate a Personal Access Token to log in to your GitHub account instead.

1. Visit the following URL: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Enter a description in the Token description field, like "Visual Studio token".
3. Click Create Token.
4. Your new Personal Access token will be displayed.
5. Copy this token, and enter it in the Token text box in the logon dialog. You can now log in as usual.

If you ever want to revoke the token, visit the GitHub Applications settings page and click Delete next to the key you wish to remove.

## Building ##

This project supports Visual Studio 2012 and newer. You will need the Visual Studio SDK installed for the particular version of Visual Studio you are testing.

Optionally, set the GitHub `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `Secrets.cs` which is in the
`Model` folder of the `GitHubIssues` project. Note that if these values are not set, the
only supported authentication method will be specifying an access token generated according
to the steps described in **Two Factor Authentication**, above.

To debug, 

1. Set `GitHubExtension` as the startup project
2. Select **Debug** &rarr; **Start Debugging**
